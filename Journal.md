6/9

I made this basic model, after realising I can put it over the extrusion. In the future, I may change the extrusion to 2020 instead. I think I might be able to route the belt over everything|

I did a lot of research before choosing this simple design so (although it was like 5 hrs) I can decrease if thats dumb.

I make a list of designs for toolhead:

# Pen Plotter Toolhead Concepts

Thinking of a few different toolhead options:

---

## 1. Rotating  
**Issue:** May be troubling depending on the drawing utensil.  
**Example:** [CreativeBloq: Best Pen Plotters](https://www.creativebloq.com/buying-guides/best-pen-plotters#section-the-best-budget-pen-plotter)

---

## 2. Weird DVD-Type Thing (Using a Z Rod with Rod Supports)  
**Issue:** Would require a *really light stepper motor* or similar. Alternative like worm gears might be needed, but they’re notoriously inefficient — Center of Mass could be problematic.  
**Example:**  
- [YouTube Demo 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkPeM0btZVQ)  
- [Main Inspiration (Shorts)](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/1ytApbsv8hw)

## 3. Rack and Pinion  
**Notes:**  
- If 3D printed: Risk of inaccuracy  
- Not commonly seen implemented  
- CNC’d custom version could be pricey — maybe ask robotics coach (potentially pay him)  
- **Pros:** Gives lots of control — currently leading option

---

## 4. Servo  
**Notes:**  
- Only supports 2 positions  
- Feels messier in practice  
- **Pros:** Very lightweight  
**Example:** [Printables Model](https://www.printables.com/model/734327-extruh-pen-plotter)

## Open Feedback & Considerations  
Any thoughts or other design constraints I should weigh?
